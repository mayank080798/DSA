## How to Identify a DP on Grids Problem

Ask yourself these questions:

âœ… 1. Is the problem based on a 2D grid or matrix?

Input is usually a 2D grid (m x n). Each cell may contain values like cost, number of paths, obstacles, letters, etc.

âœ… 2. Are you required to move through the grid with constraints?

You can typically move in limited directions:
1. Right or Down
2. All 4 directions (up, down, left, right)
3. Sometimes diagonally

âœ… 3. Does the problem ask for...

1. Count of paths?
2. Minimum or maximum value on a path?
3. Checking existence of a path or pattern?
4. Number of ways to reach a cell or configuration?

âœ… 4. Do subproblems overlap?

If you can reuse solutions to smaller subproblems (e.g., the best path to a cell can use the best paths to its neighbors), it's a strong sign for DP.

| Pattern                         | Description                                         | Example Problem                          |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Unique Paths**                | Count ways to reach bottom-right from top-left      | Leetcode 62                              |
| **Min/Max Path Sum**            | Find min/max total cost along a path                | Leetcode 64, 120                         |
| **Obstacle Grid**               | Grid has blocked cells; skip them in path counting  | Leetcode 63                              |
| **Word Search / DFS + DP**      | Check if a word exists in grid by forming sequences | Leetcode 79                              |

| **Memoized Recursion in Grid**  | Often DFS with caching on a grid                    | Island problems, Word search variations  |
| **DP with States**              | Store extra state like direction, cost, or steps    | Robot movement with energy, knight paths |
| **Counting Islands / DFS + DP** | Count separate connected regions in a binary matrix | Leetcode 200                             |

## ðŸ§° General Template for DP on Grid

#### âœ… 1. Bottom-Up Tabulation (Iterative)

```
function solveDP(grid):
    m = number of rows in grid
    n = number of columns in grid

    # Initialize DP table
    dp = matrix of size (m x n) filled with 0 or INF depending on problem

    # Base case
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]  # or 1 if it's path counting

    # Fill first row
    for j from 1 to n-1:
        dp[0][j] = transition(dp[0][j-1], grid[0][j])

    # Fill first column
    for i from 1 to m-1:
        dp[i][0] = transition(dp[i-1][0], grid[i][0])

    # Fill the rest of the DP table
    for i from 1 to m-1:
        for j from 1 to n-1:
            dp[i][j] = transition(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], grid[i][j])
    
    return dp[m-1][n-1]  # or any target cell

```
**Replace transition() with your logic like min(...) + grid[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1], etc.**

#### âœ… 2. Top-Down DP with Memoization (Recursive)

```

function solve(i, j, grid, memo):
    # Base cases
    if i < 0 or j < 0:
        return INF or 0  # depending on problem (invalid path)
    
    if i == 0 and j == 0:
        return grid[0][0]  # or 1 if it's count of paths

    if memo[i][j] is not None:
        return memo[i][j]

    # Recurrence relation
    fromTop = solve(i-1, j, grid, memo)
    fromLeft = solve(i, j-1, grid, memo)

    # Transition
    memo[i][j] = transition(fromTop, fromLeft, grid[i][j])

    return memo[i][j]


function solveDP(grid):
    m = number of rows
    n = number of cols
    memo = matrix of size (m x n) filled with None

    return solve(m-1, n-1, grid, memo)

```

ðŸ§  Replace transition() Based on Problem Type

| Problem Type              | Transition Function Example                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Min Path Sum              | `min(top, left) + grid[i][j]`                      |
| Max Path Sum              | `max(top, left) + grid[i][j]`                      |
| Count Paths               | `top + left`                                       |
| Unique Paths w/ Obstacles | `if obstacle: 0 else: top + left`                  |
| DFS Grid w/ Conditions    | use `max()` over all 4 directions with memoization |
